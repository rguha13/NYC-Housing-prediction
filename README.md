# NYC-Housing-prediction
STAT 692 Project 

The main aim of this project is to model the NYC housing data. I will also be focusing on the house location and it's importance in the price. The dataset is avaliable on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/new-york-housing-market/data

Project objectives:
Price Analysis: find the ideal price range for houses using predictive modeling. This will provide insights for investors and real estate agents to make informed decisions before purchasing a house in NYC.

Location Analysis: Analyze the importance of house location (neighborhoods, districts, regions) through EDA plots.
